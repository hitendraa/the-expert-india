  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What is GST registration cancellation and when is it required?",
      answer: "GST registration cancellation means the taxpayer will no longer be GST registered and cannot collect GST or claim input tax credit. It's required when business is discontinued, transferred, amalgamated, or when there's a change in business constitution."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the different types of GST registration cancellation?",
      answer: "There are two types: Voluntary cancellation (Section 29(1)) initiated by taxpayer for business discontinuation, transfer, or voluntary opt-out; and Cancellation by proper officer (Section 29(2)) due to non-compliance or regulatory violations."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the GST cancellation process take?",
      answer: "The process typically takes 30 days from application submission. The proper officer must issue the final order within 30 days of receiving the application or reply to show cause notice."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to Input Tax Credit upon cancellation?",
      answer: "You must pay back the ITC on inputs, semi-finished/finished goods, and capital goods held in stock. The amount is higher of ITC taken or output tax payable on such goods, calculated as per Section 29(5)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make taxable supplies during the cancellation process?",
      answer: "No, once registration is suspended (automatically upon application or by proper officer), you cannot make taxable supplies, issue tax invoices, or charge tax during the suspension period."
    },
    {
      question: "What documents are required for GST cancellation?",
      answer: "You need to submit application in FORM GST REG-16 with details of stock, capital goods, payment of liabilities, and relevant supporting documents within 30 days of the event warranting cancellation."
    },
    {
      question: "Does cancellation affect past tax liabilities?",
      answer: "No, cancellation under Section 29(3) doesn't affect liability to pay tax and other dues for any period prior to cancellation date, whether determined before or after cancellation."
